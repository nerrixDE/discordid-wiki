# FAQ

### Where is Nitro?

* **Short answer**: ****Inaccessible
* **Long answer**: Discord's API does not allow me to receive the Nitro status of an user. The requested user would have to authorize Discord.ID \(Oauth2, _like when you add a Bot_\) in order to get the information.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Early Supporter` badge is shown on discord.id if the user had Nitro before `October 10th, 2018`.

## Will there be a way to track users in a server?

* No. This is not supported by Discord and also against a core value of mine: **Privacy**. 

## Will there be a way to get details such as Server Logo, Server Icon?

* No. Beside some technical impossiblities, it's not what discord.id should be about.

## Will there be a way to lookup users by username?

* It is already possibe by adding someone as friend, going to pending friend invites and copying the person's ID, however not via discord.id and this won't happen.

## Is there an API?

* [Yes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#get-user). Use it and don't try to use discord.id as an API.
